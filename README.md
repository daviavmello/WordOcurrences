# Word Ocurrences

### Usage

Word Ocurrences is a text analyzer that reads a file and outputs statistics about that file.  It outputs the top 20 most frequent words of all words in the file, sorted by the most frequently used word. The output is a set of pairs, each pair containing a word and how many times it occurred in the file.

### Testing

The tests performed use a library called [JEST](https://jestjs.io/) which is part of JavaScript. It was performed three tests that can be found [here](https://github.com/daviavmello/WordOcurrences/blob/main/Testing.js).
